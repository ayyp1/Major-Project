## GUI developed using **Tkinter** library

- You can use the gui with **Pytorch** models where you have to make changes in models/inference.py and models/models.py to fit your own use case.
- The **client.py** file must run on **raspberrypi** or any client device which runs the nexmon firmware.
- In realtime preprocessing is enabled, if in case you want to tweak the preprocessing according to your need you can change preprocess/preprocess.py.
