# ðŸŽ“ A Deep Learning Based Human Activity Recognition Using Wi-Fi Signals
#### Major Project :

This project uses a Raspberry Pi and Wi-Fi router to collect Channel State Information (CSI) data, which tracks changes in Wi-Fi signals caused by human movements, to train a model that recognizes different human activities.

This experiment was done in closed environments with only one person in the Wi-Fi range. 

## Project Workflow

- **Hardware**: Setup Hardware components, Raspberry Pi(Rx) and Router(Tx) with UI code for data collection.

- **Data Collection**: Collecting CSI data with application of filters (preprocessing techniques) in real-time using UI.

- **Visualization**: Visualizing the CSI data and applying [v1.0](https://github.com/xaxm007/WiFi-CSI-HAR/tree/sxt2) preprocessing for verification.

- **Model Training**: Building model architecture and training the model to recognize different human activities.
